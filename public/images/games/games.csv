The Second Sight: Dead Reckoning,https://html-classic.itch.zone/html/13192052/index.html,You’re an urban legend in a county full of them.,Interactive Fiction,"LAST UPDATED: 03/22/25 (Chapter 7) (Content and trigger warnings at the bottom.) You’re an urban legend in a county full of them.  When you were thirteen, you were found passed out in the road by one of the local cops. No missing persons report. No fingerprints on file. No memories. Just a name. Oh, and some bizarre psychic powers.   You're content with simplicity. You like your isolated cabin and helping Carter track down missing persons.  You know that in theory there are more people like you out there, but you've never wanted to look behind the curtain to find out. However, with the disappearance of a local teen named Casey Powell and a recent attempt on your foster father's life, your serene, isolated life comes abruptly to its end and a new chapter begins. ✤✤✤ The Second Sight is an urban fantasy story, where you step into the role of a psychic whose strange powers have always separated them from others. Those same powers will drag you down the rabbit hole and into a world that is both familiar and foreign to everything you know. A world filled with magic, witches, fae, demons, and the unknown. You can immerse yourself in the story by customizing your protagonist's general appearance, choosing how they interact with others, and whether you lean on logic or intuition to problem solve. There are three love interests planned (more may be added depending on player reception and feedback), the genders of which will be selected by the player upon meeting them. Characters Jacob Carter Age: Late forties Race: Human. Definitely. Gender: Male Temperament: Carter radiates grizzled, old bastard energy and despite being the least paternal person in the world, he is your adoptive father. While harsh and aloof on the surface, he is also fiercely protective of you and has bent over backwards to give a decent life to a kid that isn't even his. He doesn't talk about his life before coming to Herman County and you haven't asked him, though that might change soon enough... ✤✤✤  Renard/Rowan Age: Appears to be in their late twenties or early thirties Race: Human. Maybe. Appearance: Tall and slender, white-blonde hair, and gold eyes. Temperament: Playful and witty, talking to R always feels like a game of cat and mouse and you can never be sure which role is yours. Part sad clown, part trickster, and always maddening to work with, the only things you can be certain of with R is that they probably know what they're doing. Everything else is up in the air. ✤✤✤ Zander/Zora Age: Late twenties/Early thirties Race: Human. Mostly. Appearance: Umber brown skin, black locs, grey eyes  Temperament: Gentle and resolute, Z isn't what you imagine when you think of an agent of the mysterious Magic and Anomalies Bureau. Kind, soft-spoken, and exceedingly polite, Z is Carter's former apprentice and something about them puts the old man on edge. ✤✤✤ Unknown aka ""The Kestrel"" Age: ??? Race: Definitely not human. Appearance: Tall, beautiful, elegant, with black hair and blue eyes. Temperament: The Kestrel is a complete unknown. It's impossible to say whether they are a lethal ally or deadly enemy, but either way they are a powerful dreamwalker. You don't know how long they've been watching you, but you're willing to bet that it's been longer than you're comfortable with.  ✤✤✤ This story contains sexually suggestive material, violence, talk of abductions and abuse, and mature language.
